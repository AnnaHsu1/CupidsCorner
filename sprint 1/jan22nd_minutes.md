### Date & Time: January 22 2023, 8:00 - 9:00 PM
### Members: Anna, Matteo, Radwan

### Meeting discussion
* Discussed which app to work on, agreed on the dating app.
* Dating app: more straightforward, two parties only (as opposed to three for the food delivery app), easier to test, can be more creative when it comes to adding new features
* Comparative study (3 similar apps):
1. Tinder: Standard dating app, swipe left/right, either person can message when matched
2. Bumble: Men can swipe but women have to message first
3. Hinge: Voice messages instead of texting
* Created GitHub repository and team's Google Doc
* Separated work to be done for sprint 1

### To Do

* Finish sprint 1 by January 25th and have another team meeting finalize document
